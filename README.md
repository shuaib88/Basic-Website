(This website)[https://mpcs53001.cs.uchicago.edu/~ahmed1/SoundCloud/HomePage/Final.html] shows basic web development skills. It is backed by a mySQL database with dummy data for users, songs, playlists and other items needed. 

Users can create a new username/password. Manage their account and items that are written to the database. 

## SoundCloud Directory

## FreshData
